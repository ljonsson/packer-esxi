# README
Here lies the `autoinstall` files.  They're what I define to be the preseed or kickstart file equivalents that help automate the OS installation process.

Most of the contents in here should be uploaded to web server of some sort.

The `var-files` configuration has a key `vm_boot_command` which will refer to the webserver that will launch the autoinstall chain.
